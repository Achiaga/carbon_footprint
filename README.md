## About

There is no unique path or objective for this project apart from something related with the enviroment. I started with a carbon footprint calculator because I had already the calculations from an other project. But the main concept of this project it is yet not decided. It can be whatever we (the contributors) want it to be.

**_The possibilities are endless._** It can go from this carbon footprint calculator all the way to an index volunteer project page.
  
**Carbon Footprint** is a page where the main goal is to help the enviroment, raising awareness, making it easy for people to *help the enviroment*.

  
The project is still in early development. If you have any suggestions, [file an issue](https://github.com/Achiaga/carbon_footprint/issues/new/choose) or even better, **_start contributing!_**




### Inspiration

I thought that an open-source for helping the enviroment it was something that just make sense. People contributing for the great of all. All the money (in case of donations) gets to where it needs to go. No middlemans where the money is lost. A cool page to raise awareness and try to change the world (or at least make it a bit better ðŸ˜Š )




### Contributing

>**Under construction.**

If you are interested in contribute just send me a message or talk my on twitter. I answer quicker on twitter or file an issue so we can get in touch, and I can add you to contributors. 

Although the rules are pretty simple, if you think you can improve something of the page, you do it. If you think you can write a cool feature, you do it. If you can clean code or make reusable components, you do it. All ideas are welcome. 

**The only rule is** to make the design super simple (minimalist) and easy to use by the user. :)

>Feel free to jump into the information, contribute or about page that are the ones that needs more fixing.


It is pretty simple projects:

  - Cool landing page with react three fiber.
  - Navbar Pages of Information, About and Contribute.
  - And the carbon footprint calculator.

Reason to contribute to the project:
 Although there already a lot of footprints calculator online I beleave that we, the dev comunity, can create an open-source calculator way better than the ones that already exists. and it is a good way for a first contact with contributions to open-source projects. And who knows... maybe at the end we come up with some cool ideas and change the main topic of the project for an even better one.
