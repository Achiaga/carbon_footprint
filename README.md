## About

There is no unique path or objective for this project apart from something related with the enviroment. I started with a carbon footprint calculator because I had already the calculations from an other project. But the main concept of this project it is yet not decided. It can be whatever we (the contributors) want it to be.

**_The possibilities are endless._** It can go from this carbon footprint calculator all the way to an index volunteer project page.
  
**Carbon Footprint** is a page where the main goal is to help the enviroment, raising awareness, making it easy for people to *help the enviroment*.

  
The project is still in early development. If you have any suggestions, [file an issue](https://github.com/Achiaga/carbon_footprint/issues/new/choose) or even better, *_start contributing!_*
