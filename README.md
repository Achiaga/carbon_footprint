## About

There is no unique path or objective for this project apart from something related with the enviroment. I started with a carbon footprint calculator because I had already the calculations from an other project. But the main concept of this project it is yet not decided. It can be whatever we (the contributors) want it to be.

**_The possibilities are endless._** It can go from this carbon footprint calculator all the way to an index volunteer project page.
  
**Carbon Footprint** is a page where the main goal is to help the enviroment, raising awareness, making it easy for people to *help the enviroment*.

  
The project is still in early development. If you have any suggestions, [file an issue](https://github.com/Achiaga/carbon_footprint/issues/new/choose) or even better, **_start contributing!_**




## Inspiration

I thought that an open-source for helping the enviroment it was something that just make sense. People contributing for the great of all. All the money (in case of donations) gets to where it needs to go. No middlemans where the money is lost. A cool page to raise awareness and try to change the world (or at least make it a bit better ðŸ˜Š )




## Contributing

>**Under construction.**

If you are interested in contribute just send me a message or talk my on twitter. I answer quicker on twitter or file an issue so we can get in touch, and I can add you to contributors. 

Although the rules are pretty simple, if you think you can improve something of the page, you do it. If you think you can write a cool feature, you do it. If you can clean code or make reusable components, you do it. All ideas are welcome. 

**The only rule is** to make the design super simple (minimalist) and easy to use by the user. :)

  + Contribute Page


## Contributing


For now it is a pretty simple project, so it shouldn't be hard find features to add or fix bugs. I am going to write a to-do list of things to add or fix depending on its difficulty so you can take the ones that suits you or seems more fun to you.

>Feel free to jump into the code and start tinkering with it so you understand how it works.

#### Beginner
* Do Information Page.
* Do Contribute Page.
* Add information button on the quiz questions so that on hover explains better the question.

#### Advance
* Fix Responsive layout through the page including the bugs produced by animations.
* Add different languages i18n.
* Make a simple country selector so the calculator it is more accurated
* Identifies the ip's country.
* Improve rules of quiz. So you can't continue until you fill all inputs.
* Add Testing
* Add blog-posts for information or discussions. --> so you would also need to add authentification

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

### Reason to contribute to the project:
 Although there already a lot of footprints calculator online I beleave that we, the dev comunity, can create an open-source calculator way better than the ones that already exists. And it is a good way for a first contact with contributions to open-source projects. And who knows... maybe at the end we come up with some cool ideas for the page and make a cool open-source enviroment project that recieve donations and really help the enviroment.
