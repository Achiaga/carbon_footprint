Welcome to the project.

I haven't set the rules and rewards for contributing to the project. I am still refactoring the code so it is understandable by everyone.

If you are interested in contribute just send me a message or talk my on twitter. I answer quicker on twitter.
Feel free to jump into the information, contribute or about page that are the ones that needs more fixing.

It is pretty simple projects:

  - Cool landing page with react three fiber.
  - Navbar Pages of Information, About and Contribute.
  - And the carbon footprint calculator.

Reason to contribute to the project:
 Although there already a lot of footprints calculator online I beleave that we, the dev comunity, can create an open-source calculator way better than the ones that already exists. and it is a good way for a first contact with contributions to open-source projects. And who knows... maybe at the end we come up with some cool ideas and change the main topic of the project for an even better one.
